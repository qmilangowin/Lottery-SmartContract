# Lottery-SmartContract
A simple lottery smart-contract on Ethereum with a basic front-end.
Chooses a winner based on a random dice roll and pays out the total value of ETH to the winner.

Use will need to provide their own MetaMask mnemonic and Infura API key. These have been removed in the deploy.js file here for security reasons.
